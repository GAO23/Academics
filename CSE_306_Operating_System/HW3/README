• Total number of tracks swept on each device.

Demo: 10697 for device 0, 72 for device 1, 18 for device 2
Mine: 1010 for device 0, 3 for device 1, 9 for device 2

My strategy is much more effient than the demo's


• Average number of tracks swept per I/O request.

Demo: 7 for device 0, 2 for device 1, 1 for device 2
Mine: 5 for device 0, 1 for device 1, 1 for device 2

My strategy is obviously much more effient than the demo's

• Average turnaround time for I/O requests.

Demo: 848 for device 0, 216 for device 1, 789 for device 2
Mine: 258 for device 0, 193 for device 1, 630 for device 2

My strategy is obviously much more effient than the demo's

• System throughput.
